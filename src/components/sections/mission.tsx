          Companies spend $140 billion a year on market research — yet most
          still can&apos;t explain why their best audience actually chose them.
          Demographics tell you <em>who</em>. Behavioural intelligence tells you{" "}
          <em>why</em>. AskPhi closes that gap — mapping the decision moments,
          forces, and triggers that traditional research misses.
